# Group 6 SDS 1A/B Assignment Project

This is a Donor and booking system where charities are able to look for volunteers to help out their event.
Donors and Charities are able to interact with this system via a mobile application.

Charities are able to post a listing with a description, date, time and location of their event. Donors can then
look for for a listing and apply to them. Their application then becomes pending until the charity accepts the application.
When accepted, donors are then notified by email of their successful application.

Control over communication, human interaction and meetups are out of scope for this project.
The purpose of this mobile application is only to help donors and charities find each other and
to provide some sort of a booking feature.

Our donor and booking runs on:
- The Android framework as frontend
- Spring Boot as backend
- MySQL as Database
